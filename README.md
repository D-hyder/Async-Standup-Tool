# Async-Standup-Tool
An AI-powered Slack integration for running asynchronous daily standups. Built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Slack’s interactive modals, it allows team members to submit updates (yesterday’s work, today’s focus, blockers) directly in Slack, stores responses in a database, and supports automatic summarization for team leads using AI.
